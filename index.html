                                In this meeting, the testing team have presented a draft of the testing specification.
                                Feedback was given
                                during the presentation. They need to change the format of their document in order to
                                meet the documentation standards.
                                Functional requirements should be also added into the test table. The test table should
                                be no more than 50 test, but if test
                                that needed to add into the test table, repetition test can be taken out. There are
                                couple more things that need to be change as well.

                                For the design team where I am in it, more spike work need to be done. For example, UML

                                did not attend this meeting, but she is doing the document and adding some other
                                posiible test. We also reviewed the final version of the User
                                Interface design and there is a small change where the changing language button need to
                                be. The current button is blocking two row of the words.

                                Mariusz presented teh initial development version of the User Interface presentation
                                with some animation of the program. Although the
                                program is working, but there will be a further change for the code which will have a
                                better software architecture and data structure.

                                design. We have all agreed that Mariusz is the project leader, Taavi is the deputy
                                project leader, Sophie is the QA manager, Kassy is the Deputy QA manager. Separate
                                meeting from the tutorial will be conducted on Mon at 10:00 in the morning and Wednesday
                                at 13:00. For the class design, there is an ongoing discussion on how the words are
                                stored and sorted. We have also choose to have one singular Word object for both
                                language variants.
                                Concerning matters will be discussed in the next unofficial meeting which will be on
                                Monday. There is a roadblock for testing currently due to the incomplete User Interface.

                                area and start discussing about the design of the User Interface,
                                class design, improving testing file after use cases are finalised to reference each use
                                case, less general on the test but make more test cases and be more
                                specific on each test case, when should we have meeting, etc.

                                For the User Interface, Mariusz suggested all of us give some idea and if we have spare
                                time, design the UI as well which we will get a variation of choices.
                                We will choose the most agreed design for futher implementation.
                                We also agreed that we will use just only one class for the word instead of English
                                class, Welsh Class. There will be a futher change if there is some problem
                                when implementating it to the program.

                                Different ideas were shared and discussed which we agreed to use binary tree data
                                structure for the storing and searching the list of words.
                                The first draft of the UML diagram was created and will discuss what we are missing for
                                the class in the next tutorial. I and my team had also
                                created a google doc for the Outline Structure document which is not fully complete
                                where we do not have enough and full details of the User
                                Interface for the moment.

                                Understanding what are the objectives and requirements is important. I have read the
                                SE.QA.05 - Design Specification Standards
                                and the SE.QA.09 - Java Coding Standards. I acknowledge that for the objectives of
                                SE.QA.05, it is to aid the production of a design
                                specification which is a complete and accurate translation of the client's requirements.

                                I and my team member had decided to meet on the 6th of February at 12:00 in the library
                                - Hugh Owen to discuss what algorithm,
                                data structures, class, etc. need to be used.
                                For the SE.QA.09, we have decided to use google docs which all of us who are working on
                                the document can edit the same document and we could
                                get a better scope for it.

                                Our group decided to use Discord for group communications. I have volunteered for the
                                role of <em>SE.QA.05 - Design Specification Standards</em>
                                and start to draft class designs and conduct spike work on main elements such as reading
                                JSON files, deciding which data structure we
                                should use for storing, searching in the list of words. On the other hand, I have also
                                volunteered for the role of
                                <em>SE.QA.09 - Java Coding Standards</em> which it covers the standards to which Java
                                source code must be produced.
