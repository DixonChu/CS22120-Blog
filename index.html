                                Our group decided to use Discord for group communications. I have volunteered for the
                                role of <em>SE.QA.05 - Design Specification Standards</em>
                                and start to draft class designs and conduct spike work on main elements such as reading
                                JSON files, deciding which data structure we
                                should use for storing, searching in the list of words. On the other hand, I have also
                                volunteered for the role of
                                <em>SE.QA.09 - Java Coding Standards</em> which it covers the standards to which Java
                                source code must be produced.

                                Understanding what are the objectives and requirements is important. I have read the
                                SE.QA.05 - Design Specification Standards
                                and the SE.QA.09 - Java Coding Standards. I acknowledge that for the objectives of
                                SE.QA.05, it is to aid the production of a design
                                specification which is a complete and accurate translation of the client's requirements.

                                I and my team member had decided to meet on the 6th of February at 12:00 in the library
                                - Hugh Owen to discuss what algorithm,
                                data structures, class, etc. need to be used.
                                For the SE.QA.09, we have decided to use google docs which all of us who are working on
                                the document can edit the same document and we could
                                get a better scope for it.

                                Different ideas were shared and discussed which we agreed to use binary tree data
                                structure for the storing and searching the list of words.
                                The first draft of the UML diagram was created and will discuss what we are missing for
                                the class in the next tutorial. I and my team had also
                                created a google doc for the Outline Structure document which is not fully complete
                                where we do not have enough and full details of the User
                                Interface for the moment.

                                In this meeting, Taavi has presented the draft of the User Interface. Kassy and I
                                presented
                                the Design Specification Standards. There is nothing much we could present which we do
                                not
                                have
                                enough information. Kassy and Martynas presented Test Procedure Standards as well.

                                manager, Bernie suggest that we could add something that is more specific
                                to the test. Since three of the members unable to attend to the tutorial due to personal
                                problem, Sophie will plan to have a group meeting which everyone needs to be there to
                                brainstorm some ideas and suggestion.

                                since Sophie, Martynas, Mariusz and I are going to the GitLab workshop at 14:00. The rest of the team will continue discuss and we will follow
                                up what we have missed.

                                This is the first group meeting outside the schedule. All of us meet at the Think Tank area and start discussing about the design of the User Interface,
                                class design, improving testing file after use cases are finalised to reference each use case, less general on the test but make more test cases and be more 
                                specific on each test case, when should we have meeting, etc.

                                For the User Interface, Mariusz suggested all of us give some idea and if we have spare time, design the UI as well which we will get a variation of choices. 
                                We will choose the most agreed design for futher implementation.  
                                We also agreed that we will use just only one class for the word instead of English class, Welsh Class. There will be a futher change if there is some problem 
                                when implementating it to the program.
